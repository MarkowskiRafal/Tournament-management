## About
In college, there was a local competition in computer games between several teams in which many students participated. Everything was done by email, so I thought that an 
interesting solution would be to create an application that would allow the organization of tournaments. I'm currently working on the application where users can submit their 
teams to tournaments held in computer games. An admin could accept teams and set them up against each other and update them with wins and losses up to the final rounds.
