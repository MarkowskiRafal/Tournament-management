## About
In college, there was a local computer game competition between several teams with many students participating. Everything was done via email, so I thought it would be interesting 
to create an app that would allow people to organize tournaments. I am currently working on such an application, in which users can submit their teams to tournaments organized in 
computer games. An administrator could accept teams and set them against each other and update them with wins and losses until the final rounds.
